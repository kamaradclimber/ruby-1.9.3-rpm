# What is this spec?

This is a fork from https://github.com/imeyer/ruby-1.9.2-rpm.

### How to install

#### RHEL/CentOS 5/6

    yum install -y rpm-build rpmdevtools
    rpmdev-setuptree
    cd ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES
    wget http://ftp.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/1.9/ruby-1.9.3-p0.tar.gz
    cd ~/rpmbuild/SPECS
    curl https://raw.github.com/rilindo/ruby-1.9.3-rpm/master/ruby19.spec > ruby19.spec
    rpmbuild -bb ruby19.spec
    rpm -Uvh ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/ruby-1.9.3p0-1.ruby-1.9.3p90-1.i386.rpm

**PROFIT!**

### What it does

+ Builds
+ Installs
+ Overwrites/upgrades your currently installed ruby package (**DANGEROUS**)

### What it does **not** do

+ Split packages into ruby-libs, ruby-devel, etc (looking for help here)
+ Install alongside Ruby 1.8.x

### Distro support

Tested working (as sane as I could test for) on:

* CentOS 6.1 x86_64
* CentOS 6.2 i686
* CentOS 5.7 x86_64

This should on RHEL, though. Let me know if it doesn't.

### Personal thoughts

Working off from https://github.com/imeyer/ruby-1.9.2-rpm. Usual disclaimers apply.
